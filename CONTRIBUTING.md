# How to contribute

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy windows line endings. :)
* When committing, reference your issue (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the **master branch** of the repository.

At this point you're waiting on us to merge your pull request. We'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.

Thanks for contributing!
